1. Install PostgreSQL adapter:
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

2. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname"
   ```

3. The app will automatically use PostgreSQL if `DATABASE_URL` is set.

### Database Schema

The system includes 15+ database tables:
- Users
- Courses
- Modules
- Topics
- Lessons
- Enrollments
- Quizzes
- Quiz Questions
- Quiz Submissions
- Quiz Answers
- Essays
- Essay Submissions

## 🎨 Customization

### Biology Theming
The platform is biology-focused. Customize templates in `templates/` directory:
- Add biology imagery (cells, DNA, etc.)
- Use biology terminology throughout
- Color schemes: Green (nature), Blue (science)

### File Uploads
Configure in `config.py`:
```python
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'ppt', 'pptx', 'mp4', 'mp3', 'wav', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'}
```

### Payment Integration
Replace the simulated payment in `app.py` with real gateway:
- Stripe
- PayPal
- Braintree
- Square

## 🔒 Security

- Passwords hashed with Werkzeug security
- Role-based access control decorators
- Protected routes with Flask-Login
- File upload validation
- SQL injection prevention (SQLAlchemy ORM)
